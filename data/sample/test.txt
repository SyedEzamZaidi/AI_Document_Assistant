The old library stood at the corner of Main Street, its red brick facade weathered by decades of rain and sun. Inside, the smell of aged paper and leather bindings filled the air, creating an atmosphere that transported visitors to another era. Rows upon rows of wooden shelves stretched toward the high ceiling, each one packed with books that held stories, knowledge, and forgotten memories. A librarian sat behind the front desk, her reading glasses perched on her nose as she carefully stamped the due date on a patron's borrowed books. Near the window, a young student hunched over a thick textbook, occasionally glancing outside at the world passing by. The afternoon sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished wooden floor.
